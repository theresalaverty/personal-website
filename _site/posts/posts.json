    "contents": "\nI have found myself increasing frustrated with my relationship with products like Facebook and Instagram. As a millennial, I grew up without any form of social media or cell phones until some point in high school. Now, I wake up every morning with my phone in hand. With the two-factor authentication required for so many websites and products that I use as well as the convenience of always having a smartphone camera in my pocket, I recognize that it will be nearly impossible to get rid of my smartphone at this point. Through the creation of this website though, I hope to deactivate most of my social media accounts to spend less time doomscrolling and more time living. I’m excited to keep a blog again, which I haven’t managed to do since before grad school (note: I might eventually migrate those old Wordpress posts over to here). Will I miss seeing frequent photos and personal updates from my friends and family? You betcha! I hope you won’t mind staying in touch with phone calls, texts, emails, or visits to Las Cruces! And so begins this journey…\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Christmas Day 2024 hike along the base of the Organ Mountains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
