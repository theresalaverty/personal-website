    "contents": "\nI have found myself increasing frustrated with my relationship with products like Facebook and Instagram. As a millennial, I grew up without any form of social media or cell phones really until around the time that I was graduating from high school. Now I wake up every morning with my phone in hand. With the two-factor authentication required for so many websites and products that I use as well as the convenience of always having a smartphone camera in my pocket, I recognize that it will be nearly impossible to get rid of my smartphone. Through the creation of this website though, I hope to deactivate most of my social media accounts to spend less time doomscrolling and more time living. Will I miss seeing frequent photos and personal updates of my friends and family? You betcha! I hope you wonâ€™t mind staying in touch with phone calls, texts, emails, or visits to Las Cruces!\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Christmas Day 2024 hike along the base of the Organ Mountains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
